DEVELOPMENT
-----------

1. SOURCE CODE
--------------
Source code is hosted in the AST Research Group SVN server.
If you need more information contact the authors.

2. STACKSYNC
----------
StackSync is almost entirely based on Java.
The development IDE is NetBeans 7.


2.1. BUILD REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
* JDK 6, or higher
* Apache Ant


2.2. BUILDING & RUNNING
-----------------------
StackSync can be built and run from within the NetBeans IDE 7.
Import the project to NetBeans and once imported change the run parameters:
- Right click on the project.
- In the properties windows, click on the Run category.
- Change VM Options with the correct parameters (-Dstacksync.home=PATH_TO_PROJECT)


3. CONFIGURATION
----------------
All important configuration can be done using the StackSync preferences window.
However, for debug/development purposes, manual configuration might be 
necessary.

By default, StackSync stores all user data at ~/.stacksync (this can be changed
using the --config/-c parameter). Relative to the config directory, the 
following files and directories can be found:

- config.xml  Main configuration file. 

- cache/      Local cache that temporarily stores file chunks and metadata.
              If StackSync is not running, it can be safely deleted.
          
- db/         Derby database directory. The database is created when StackSync
              first persists any file versions. Deleting this directory
              resets the local version history. If anything doesn't work as
              expected, delete this folder and restart StackSync.
            
- profiles/   Stores the profile pictures of other users.
 
Every time that the folder ~/.stacksync is deleted, StackSync will show the wizard to get the user data again.

4. STORAGE BACK-END
-------------------
In order to let the user choose the storage back-end (FTP, Swift...) StackSync has to be executed with the parameter -ep (enable plugins), otherwise the storage back-end will be Swift.


5. MANUAL
-------------------

Some important classes and packages.

Localwatcher (com.stacksync.desktop.watch.local): 
This thread watches the synchronized folder, when an event occurs in the folder (new/delete/modify file or folder) the thread launches an event to the indexer.

Periodic (com.stacksync.desktop.periodic): 
This thread helps to Localwatcher, when the event is missed by Localwatcher, the periodic thread launches the event to the indexer.

Indexer (com.stacksync.desktop.index): 
This thread processes all the previous events. Folder events only create metadata; File events create chunks and queue the files for the Uploader thread to process.

Uploader (com.stacksync.desktop.repository): 
This thread has a queue of files, for each file the thread uploads the chunks to the storage.

Client Middleware (com.stacksync.desktop.syncserver): 
This package contains all the communication to the sync service. The desktop client calls Synchronous/Asynchronous methods to send/receive metadata to/from the server.

Server Middleware (com.stacksync.syncservice.middleware): 
Here there are metadata classes shared with the server and the server frontend.

RemoteWatcher (com.stacksync.desktop.watch.remote): 
Is a periodic task, this task sends the metadata to the sync service when all chunks are already uploaded to the storage.

Cache (com.stacksync.desktop.periodic): 
This thread monitors the chunks in the cache folder and removes the old/unused chunks.

Connection Plugins (com.stacksync.desktop.connection.plugins): 
In this package there are the classes related to storage plugins. These classes have to be inherited to add new plugin.

    Connection.java
    This class contains the connection information such as Host, Port, User or Password.

    PluginInfo.java
    This class contains the name and version of the plugin.

    TransferManager.java
    This class has all the methods to interact with the storage (Connect, Upload, Download...).

Chunker (com.stacksync.desktop.index):
This package contains the Chunker, the Chunker splits the files and generate hashes. The Chunker supports two algorithms (Adler32 and Sha1). 

    The Chunker.java has the abstract method createChecksum. The classes ChunkerAdler32 and ChunkerSha1 inherit from Chunker implementing the method 
    createChecksum with the corresponding algorithm.
